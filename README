If you have syntastic set up with vim, and you use git worktrees the way I do,
then put these files in ~/.vim/ and add "source ~/.vim/syntasticrc.vim" to your
~/.vimrc , and you will be able to do

trillian:~/devel/github.com/grub2$ git branch origin/fedora-27 fedora-27-bls
trillian:~/devel/github.com/grub2$ git worktree add fedora-27-bls fedora-27-bls
trillian:~/devel/github.com/grub2$ cd fedora-27-bls
trillian:~/devel/github.com/grub2/fedora-27-bls$ ./autogen.sh
trillian:~/devel/github.com/grub2/fedora-27-bls$ mkdir build
trillian:~/devel/github.com/grub2/fedora-27-bls$ cd build ; ../configure --whatever ; cd ..
trillian:~/devel/github.com/grub2/fedora-27-bls$ vim <some_grub_file>
trillian:~/devel/github.com/grub2/fedora-27-bls$ make -C build

And syntastic should work correctly, with the assumption that you're on an
x86_64 machine and you aren't hacking on code for another arch.  (that's
probably possible to make work somewhat better, but it hasn't been worth the
time.)
